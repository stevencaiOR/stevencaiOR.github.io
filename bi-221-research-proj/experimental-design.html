				To observe the diversity of species, the design of our experiment involved extracting nematodes from a slug and extracting the gene sequences from said nematodes. Multiple groups were involved in the experiment, each responsible for collecting and observing a slug and its corresponding nematodes. To differentiate all the groups’ nematodes from each other, we first began by labeling our slug with our group ID and gathered data regarding its species, mass and length. In terms of extracting the nematode, we first collected the slug’s feces, as that is a known location where the nematodes reside. Once the nematodes were extracted, we applied a worm lysis buffer (WLB) to isolate the DNA from the organism’s cells. The DNA extracted was then replicated using a technique known as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with the goal to make the later observation stages easier. This process involved heating and cooling stages that separated the DNA strands and allowed certain enzymes to proceed with cloning. Since DNA has a negative charge, we placed DNA in a gel matrix connected to a negative anode and a positive cathode. Smaller DNA fragments traveled closer to the positive cathode, allowing us to observe the separated DNA fragments and identify different gene sequences.
