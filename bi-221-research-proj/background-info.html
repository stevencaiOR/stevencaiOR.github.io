				Nematodes are microscopic worms that are part of the Nematoda phylum. Though found in many environments, the genus that our research group is interested in is part of the genus Phasmarhabditis. This particular genus of nematodes inhabits slugs as parasites, which is crucial given the presence of slugs as pests in agriculture. Currently, there is little knowledge as to how certain nematodes will affect slug biodiversity in the Pacific Northwest. Furthermore, studies have shown that species of nematodes are known to have negative impacts directly on agriculture, making it vital to understand the biodiversity of nematodes that are being introduced into agriculture (Usovsky 2022). Therefore, the goal of our research is to study nematode biodiversity and how various factors within a slug may affect it.
