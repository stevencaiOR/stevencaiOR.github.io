				In conclusion, there is no positive association between slug mass and nematode biodiversity. Our initial hypothesis that increases in slug mass will lead to greater nematode biodiversity was incorrect. This is potentially due to the limitation that each slug in our research came from a different area. This eliminates the possibility of grouping the slugs based on location and observing trends per group. Such a factor would have been essential, as a study done by Ruth Gingold concluded that a diversity of microhabitats in a certain region was strongly associated with increased nematofauna (2010).
